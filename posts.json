The Earth’s dance around the sun will continue until well after the last iteration of humanity and that of all the other creatures has come and gone. It’s really about saving ourselves.</p><p>It shouldn’t take an international agreement to compel us to recognize the damage we have done to our planet and that the power to save ourselves lies in the hands of the current generation. Likewise, it shouldn’t take a single scientist — much less 97% of scientists across 80 countries— to recognize that when we pour garbage into the atmosphere, the air that all living beings then breathe is polluted. We only get as good as we give which is why we need to abide by the terms of the Paris Agreement before it’s too late — because there will come a day when it is just too late.</p><p>The core tenet of the Paris Agreement is to strengthen the global response to climate change and to mitigate the damage we have done to the only home we may ever have. Additionally, all signatories have to report on those efforts. In support of that, H.R.9, the <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/9/text\">Climate Action Now Act</a>, sponsored by 150+ Representatives, was introduced on March 27, 2019. If successful, it will direct the President to develop a plan for the United States to meet its reporting requirements under the Paris Agreement, despite his 2017 declaration that we would be withdrawing. This bill has emerged from the Committee on Energy and Commerce and is scheduled to be heard on the House floor on <strong>April 29th</strong>.</p><h4>What you can do</h4><p>Reach out to your representative and let them know your thoughts on global warming.

There’s really more in the report than we can comfortably summarize here so, rather than attempt to do so, we’ll focus on one sentence.</p><blockquote>Congress has Article I authority to define generally applicable criminal law and apply it to all persons-including the President. (<a href=\"https://thebulwark.com/app/uploads/2019/04/report.pdf\">p. 176</a>)</blockquote><p>This is an invitation to impeach. The substance of Mueller’s report boils down to a finding that the Trump campaign certainly <em>tried</em> to collude with Russia, may have <em>actually</em> colluded with Russia, and almost certainly attempted to cover up its involvement with Russia but that the DOJ’s official position that “a sitting President can not be indicted” makes actually charging the chief executive with a crime extremely difficult.</p><p>So Mueller lobbed the ball into Congress’ court. The report as much as urges Congress to begin impeachment proceedings.</p><h3>Impeach?</h3><p>While it is Congress’ responsibility to check the Presidency via the threat of impeachment, Democrats seem divided on this issue. Impeaching Mr. Trump is a major step and there are more than a few Democrats who view the Republican effort to impeach Bill Clinton as a bit of a cautionary tale. While Democrats control the House, Republicans control the Senate and both are needed to remove the President from office. Bill Clinton’s former press secretary argues against impeachment because he believes there’s a bigger prize in play: <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/22/opinion/theres-a-bigger-prize-than-impeachment.html?action=click&amp;module=Opinion&amp;pgtype=Homepage\">the complete destruction of the GOP.</a></p><h3>Impeach!</h3><p>While the Clinton impeachment looms large in any discussion of the topic, a lot has changed in the past twenty years. Democrats successfully cast the Clinton impeachment as a “partisan witch-hunt” (a phrase that Trump is intentionally using in an attempt to replicate their success) and, as a result, several Republicans broke ranks with their party and voted to acquit Clinton in his Senate trial. Democrats may hope to avoid the appearance of overt partisanship by approaching impeachment cautiously.</p><p>Caution is probably warranted. It’s worth noting that the Starr investigation into the Clinton administration began in 1994 — a year in which Republicans won a House majority with an 8-point popular vote majority. Just two years later, the Starr investigation (and Newt Gingrich’s vindictive brand of partisanship) had burned through all of that good will and then some. The Congressional popular vote swung 16 points and Democrats posted an 8-point victory in 1996.</p><p>Clinton would be impeached three years later and, though he remained popular despite the impeachment, report, and trial, Democrats lost the 2000 election, in part because running on the Clinton legacy was unadvisable. Viewed that way, impeachment and investigation was a mixed bag for the GOP. It cost them in the 1996 election but probably won them the 2000 one.</p><h3>Impeach?!?</h3><p>Of course, if the House votes to impeach that doesn’t remove the President from office. The Senate would have to convict the President in a trial overseen by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. It’s extremely unlikely that the Senate — which has only gotten more partisan since 1999 — would see enough Republican defectors to convict Trump of anything, even with an ironclad legal case and a mountain of evidence.</p><p>The risk is that Democrats would look feckless and weak should they try and fail to remove Trump from office for obstruction and campaign finance violations. Of course, they risk much the same things if they don’t.</p><h3>Tell Congress What You Think</h3><p>The decision to impeach depends on individual Representatives and what they think the Senate will do. Your voice matters in this decision.

Let’s just run down the political news of the week, shall we?</p><h3>Mueller Time</h3><p>Attorney General Barr released his f̵a̵n̵f̵i̵c̵ summary of the Mueller Report late last month. In a development that shocked absolutely no one, polling shows that <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2019/03/29/708170822/poll-finds-overwhelming-majority-of-americans-want-full-mueller-report-to-be-rel\">most Americans don’t trust the Trump administration to be its own judge and jury</a> when it comes to deciding if the President broke any laws.</p><p>Earlier this week, the House Judiciary Committee <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/house-judiciary-prepares-subpoena-full-mueller-report-n990406\">voted on party lines to begin the process of subpoenaing the full Mueller Report</a>. Republicans objected, citing the Barr summary as evidence that Democrats were essentially on a fishing expedition for anything damaging to the President. The New York Times headlined the following morning with “<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/03/us/politics/william-barr-mueller-report.html\">Some on Mueller’s Team Say Report Was More Damaging Than Barr Revealed</a>”</p><h3>Mar-a-Lago</h3><p>Back in February, ESPN reported that <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/26055197/patriots-owner-robert-kraft-facing-charges-solicitation-prostitution\">New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft was being charged with soliciting a prostitute</a> at the “Orchids of Asia Day Spa” in Jupiter, Florida. That spa was previously (not at the time of Kraft’s charge) owned by Cindy Yang, <a href=\"https://www.miamiherald.com/news/politics-government/article227186429.html\">who cheered the Patriots to victory at a Super Bowl party with President Trump</a>.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/455/0*kSTTYvM3b7MGyfc8\" /><figcaption>Photo (and caption) from NYT</figcaption></figure><p><a href=\"https://www.miamiherald.com/news/politics-government/article227358809.html\">Yang’s other massage businesses have also fallen under scrutiny for prostitution</a>.</p><p>But while Yang has funneled thousands of dollars to Republican campaigns, she may also be (wittingly or unwittingly) working for the Chinese government. Yang has been promoting events at Mar-a-Lago and selling access to the President to wealthy Chinese business executives. It was one of Yang’s Mar-a-Lago events that Yujing Zhang was attending when she was arrested with “<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/03/us/politics/mar-a-lago-chinese-malware.html\">four cellphones, a hard drive, a laptop and a malware-infected thumb drive</a>”</p><h3>Tax Season</h3><p><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/house-democrats-seek-six-years-of-trumps-personal-and-business-tax-returns/2019/04/03/7a864eda-565d-11e9-8ef3-fbd41a2ce4d5_story.html\">House Democrats on the Ways and Means Committee officially requested access to President Trump’s last six years of tax returns on Wednesday</a>. Trump continues to resist requests to see his taxes, claiming that he is still under audit from the IRS. The request from Ways and Means asks the IRS for “broad details about Trump’s personal tax returns from 2013 to 2018 — including whether the returns are or have been under audit.”</p><p>This is likely the first exchange of a long and drawn out fight between the President and the Congress over Mr Trump’s taxes.</p><h3>Other Assorted Malfeasance</h3><p><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/jared-kushner-identified-as-senior-white-house-official-whose-security-clearance-was-denied-by-career-officials/2019/04/03/fefa8dbe-5623-11e9-814f-e2f46684196e_story.html\">Jared Kushner’s security clearance was denied because of concerns about foreign influence over him</a> but the White House demanded it be granted anyway. Acting Secretary of the Interior David Bernhardt de-registered as a federal lobbyist in November of 2016 but <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/04/climate/david-bernhardt-interior-lobbying.html\">newly released invoices show he was still lobbying for agribusiness clients through April 2017</a>, the same month he was appointed as Secretary of the Interior. <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/mitch-mcconnell-undid-213-years-of-senate-history-in-33-minutes/2019/04/03/58b3eaca-565c-11e9-9136-f8e636f1f6df_story.html?utm_term=.18b9c0c14e32\">Mitch McConnell finally gave up all pretense that a Senate confirmation is anything more than a partisan rubber stamp by reducing the amount of time the Senate will debate even low-level Presidential appointments</a>. In so doing he ends a deliberative tradition begun more than 213 years ago by Aaron Burr (sir). Also, the President of the United States thinks that <a href=\"https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/politics/2019/04/03/donald-trump-wind-turbines-chuck-grassley-iowa-idiotic/3356122002/\">the noises from windmills cause cancer</a> (link does not go to The Onion).</p><h3>Tell Congress What You Think</h3><p>To write to your Representatives and Senators, send the word Resist to Resistbot on <a href=\"http://m.me/resistbot\">Facebook Messenger</a>, <a href=\"http://t.me/resistbot\">Telegram</a>, or as a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/messages/compose?recipient_id=835740314006511618&amp;text=resist\">Twitter direct message</a>.

Barr was involved in the Iran Contra coverup. He was specifically picked by Trump after the last Attorney General refused to recuse himself from the Russia investigation and he’s written extensively on how the entire investigation is a waste of time and money and shouldn’t have happened. So there’s plenty of reason to raise an eyebrow at his getting to speak <strong>for</strong> the Mueller Investigation.</p><p>But no one need entertain such theories to believe that releasing the report <strong>in full</strong> is a good idea.</p><p>Because, while the Mueller Investigation is partially about answering questions like “did the President of the United States collude with a foreign power” and “did the President of the United States obstruct justice,” it is primarily about a much bigger question: are our elections legitimate?</p><p>This is a really big and unsettling question and it needs to be answered. Democracy is little more than the radical idea that power derives from a mandate from the masses (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2c-X8HiBng\">not from some farcical aquatic ceremony</a>) and elections are the way in which we determine that mandate. If our elections are untrustworthy, if authority has been conferred upon someone without a mandate, then the Republic itself is under attack.</p><p>That’s why the report has to be released in full. Americans have got to know if their government is legitimate. The merest shadow of a doubt can spread like a cancer and throw the entire premise of democratic self determination into question.</p><p>In many ways, it would be easier to accept that some small number of the Trump campaign — even the President himself — were turned by Russian intelligence and betrayed their country. That kind of corruption could be excised and destroyed. But if the Mueller report shows — collusion or no — that the Russian government acted to influence the 2016 election and that the Republican party <strong>knew and did nothing</strong> because it benefited them politically, that would be damning indeed: not collusion, not obstruction, but a deep and profound betrayal of everything for which Americans have sacrificed, fought, and died over the last 250 years.</p><p>We have to know. We have to release the report.</p><h3>Tell Congress What You Think</h3><p>If the American people could expect satisfactory answers about the 2016 election from Trump and his political appointees there would never have been a reason to create a Special Counsel is the first place. The investigation is not complete until the results are made public and only Congress has the power to demand that.

The difference between then and now is simple: Democrats control the House of Representatives. No, this isn’t the Democrats’ fault or, really, the Republicans’ fault. It’s about filling air-time and column inches.</p><p>Most reporters would prefer to write on policy and legislation but the chances of that have long evaporated. Republicans still hold power, but nearly every path they have to enact significant change is blocked: Democrats control the House, the government shutdown only strengthened their position, and the imaginary-emergency is tied up in the Courts.</p><p>Likewise, while Democrats have a long list of policies they’d like to enact, the hard truth is that none of them will receive a vote in the Republican controlled Senate. Most Americans favor, and Democrats have bills pending in the House to address election reform, prescription drug price reductions, climate change, firearms background checks, and a host of others besides, but there’s not much point in wasting ink covering legislation that will never see the light of a Senate floor vote.</p><p>As a result, the stories that <em>can</em> be covered are those of personal attacks, innuendo, and partisan mudslinging. It’s not that it wasn’t going on last year too; it just wasn’t getting covered.</p><p>So all of this embittered bickering, sniping, and the partisan gnashing of teeth? That’s the sound of divided government. It’s the brakes squealing on the Trump Train and that’s not such a terrible sound.</p><h3>Tell Congress What You Think</h3><p>Republicans are meeting resistance in Washington, DC but that doesn’t mean voters can let up the pressure.

These bills seek to connect democratic participation with vehicular freedom by creating an <em>opt-out</em> system of voter registration that will replace the current opt-in system many of us are familiar with. This new process will be accomplished by revamping the current Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) application for an initial, renewal, or duplication of a driver’s license or state issued ID card, to include language that automatically registers the applicant to vote.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/automatic-voter-registration.aspx\">As is the norm, there are two mindsets as to whether or not AVR is a help or a hindrance.</a></p><h4>Yay!</h4><p>Those in favor of AVR say that the opt-in process, through a routine and necessary transaction — interaction with the DMV — means that voters won’t have to worry about registration deadlines or application submissions. One trip to the DMV will give them a license to drive and an equally important license to vote. They will, in a sense, be automatically enfranchised. Proponents say that this process may also result in greater voter turnout and cleaner voter registration rolls because the process updates existing registrations with current addresses, both of which will lend itself to more efficient elections.</p><h4>Nay!</h4><p>Those opposed to AVR say that the opt-out process is an infringement on an individual&#39;s First Amendment right to free speech and that the government should not be in the business of telling Americans what to do. Opponents also fear that non-citizens will be registered to vote though the twelve states that permit non-citizens to have drivers licenses have not found evidence of increased voter fraud as a result.</p><h3>Here’s What You Can Do</h3><p>Here are the states that have pending legislation: Arizona, Arkansas, California, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Maryland, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, and Vermont.</p><p>If you live in one of the above states, send STATE to Resistbot and encourage your state legislature to support Automatic Voter Registration. And, as always, you can write to Congress about this or any other topic by sending the word Resist to Resistbot on <a href=\"http://m.me/resistbot\">Facebook Messenger</a>, <a href=\"http://t.me/resistbot\">Telegram</a>, or as a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/messages/compose?recipient_id=835740314006511618&amp;text=resist\">Twitter direct message</a>.

It took well over a year to build, but <a href=\"https://resistbot.news/you-can-now-text-your-state-lawmakers-with-resistbot-2cf8773ee06d\">we did it</a>!</p><h3>Before Resistbot, It Was Real Complicated to Contact State Government</h3><p>Let’s say you’re a voter in Pittsburgh and want to write a message of support for Gov. Wolf’s <a href=\"https://www.governor.pa.gov/governor-wolf-announces-21st-century-voting-reform-plan-pennsylvania/\">21st century voting reform plan</a> to the Governor and your Representative and Senator in the Pennsylvania General Assembly. You would have to go to 11 different websites*, enter your address 3 times, and send 1 fax!</p><p>The goal was to eliminate all these steps, so all you have to do is text “state” to 50409. Resistbot will find your state legislators and governor and deliver your message like magic.</p><p>This is a game changer: now any influencer or advocacy group can say “text ‘state’ to 50409” to mobilize constituents around a bill under consideration in state government.</p><h3>Challenge One: State Legislatures Are Inconsistent</h3><p>To Resistbot users it’s magic — and behind the scenes, state legislatures are awesome and complicated.</p><p>Some state legislatures have a consistent web form for all members, which is great. Some legislators make their email address public, which is pretty good too. And regrettably, many lawmakers still only publicize a fax number or postal mail address. To cover everybody, we needed to support web forms, email, fax, and postal mail.</p><p>State legislatures are also all over the place in representational structure. In most states, one person is represented by one state senator and one state representative. But many states are unique. For example:</p><ul><li>A person in unicameral Nebraska is represented by one Senator only.</li><li>A person in Vermont is represented by one Representative and up to six Senators.</li><li>A person in New Hampshire has up to 10 Representatives in some House districts and may also be represented by one or more Representatives in <a href=\"https://www.eagletribune.com/news/local_news/floterial-districts-are-back-in-granite-state/article_c535dc48-26e2-5083-8a74-62c6672c8344.html\">“floterial” districts</a> which subsume multiple normal districts.</li><li>A person in Puerto Rico is represented by two Senators from their Senate district, 14 Senators elected at-large, one Representative from their House district, and 11 Representatives elected at-large. (There are especially many Senators because of Puerto Rico’s <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senate_of_Puerto_Rico#Majority_and_minority_parties\">unique guarantee of minimum legislative minority representation</a>.)</li></ul><h3>Challenge Two: Open Data Is Fragmented</h3><p>Before 2019, all of Resistbot’s database of Congressional representatives was hard-coded and maintained by hand. This was untenable as the transition to the 116th Congress approached. We also knew we could never maintain a database of 7500 state legislators and contact info by hand.</p><p>We decided to leverage existing open data sources, which allowed us to keep Resistbot up to date while improving open data. There is no single free source that covers all levels of government, so we needed a way to pull from a bunch of sources: <a href=\"https://openstates.org\">Open States</a>, <a href=\"https://theunitedstates.io/congress-legislators\">UnitedStates.io</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/unitedstates/contact-congress\">Contact Congress</a>. We also introduced our own open-source <a href=\"https://github.com/resistbot/contact-officials\">repository</a> of web contact form configurations for governors and state legislatures.</p><h3>Challenge Three: Resistbot Needed a Generalized Data Model</h3><p>Resistbot previously assumed that a user has two US Senators reachable by web form, one US Representative reachable by <a href=\"https://www.house.gov/doing-business-with-the-house/communicating-with-congress-cwc\">CWC</a>, one governor reachable by fax or postal mail, and that’s it.</p><p>Now, a user in Maryland would have also three state Delegates and one state Senator contactable by web form and email.</p><p>We needed to create a general database of all a user’s state and federal representatives, support writing to any or all of them, and deliver the message in the fastest manner possible.</p><h3><em>Discovery</em>: a Database of Officials and How to Contact Them</h3><p>We implemented <em>Discovery</em> to bring all elected officials and how to contact them into one generic data model.</p><p>First, we needed to collect all elected officials in one place. Every hour, we pull the latest lawmaker data from <a href=\"https://openstates.org\">Open States</a> and <a href=\"https://theunitedstates.io/congress-legislators\">UnitedStates.io</a>. We made an admin interface for overwriting any field, like fax numbers or Twitter handle (in addition to contributing updates upstream where possible; one exception is most elected official databases store only one fax number, but it’s important for Resistbot to cycle through all of an official’s fax numbers). We also used the <em>Discovery</em> admin interface to manually add information on governors. Eventually we would love to pull in more types of officials, like city and county lawmakers!</p><p>Next, we taught <em>Discovery</em> how to contact every official. The best way to contact an official is with their official web contact form, so an amazing crew of Resistbot volunteers scoured governor and state legislatures for web contact forms, teaching Resistbot how to use 73 contact forms for governors and state legislative chambers. (The trickiest part was the state legislative chambers — it can be very tricky to automatically choose the correct state legislator in some states, so we introduced metaprogramming in the contact form configurations to accommodate an entire legislative chamber with one configuration.) These are all open-source in our new <a href=\"https://github.com/resistbot/contact-officials\">contact-officials</a> repo. Every hour, <em>Discovery</em> pulls them in, and also pulls from <a href=\"https://github.com/unitedstates/contact-congress\">contact-congress</a>, which covers all US Senators’ web contact forms.</p><p>Finally, <em>Discovery</em>’s API exposes officials per user, best delivery method per official, and delivery method details per official and delivery method.</p><h3>Example With Engineering Gossip : )</h3><p>Let’s say we text `state` to Resistbot from Braddock, PA. After we type our message:</p><ol><li>Resistbot asks service <em>Messenger</em> to send the message to PA state government officials for House district 34 and Senate district 43.</li><li><em>Messenger </em>asks <em>Discovery</em> who those officials are. <em>Discovery</em> returns Rep. Lee, Sen. Costa, and Gov. Wolf. <em>Messenger</em> enqueues three messages in the ingress SQS queue.</li><li><em>Pathfinder</em> reads from the ingress SQS queue and for each message, asks <em>Discovery </em>which delivery method is best for delivering to the specific official. For example, the best delivery method for Rep. Lee is the official PA House web contact form, so <em>Discovery</em> returns ‘web_form’. <em>Pathfinder</em> therefore adds this message to the ‘web_form’ SQS queue. (There is one queue for each possible delivery method: ‘web_form’, ‘cwc’, ‘email’, ‘fax’, ‘mail’.)</li><li><em>Mercury</em> grabs the message for Rep. Lee, fires up a headless browser, downloads the delivery method details for ‘web_form’ delivery method from <em>Discovery</em>, then follows the steps therein to fill in the user’s message and contact information and confirm the message was sent. (Each delivery method queue has its own consumer; the message to Sen. Costa will end up in the ‘fax’ queue, from which <em>Gemini</em> will send the message to Twilio using the ‘fax’ delivery method details from <em>Discovery</em>.)</li></ol><h3>Now It’s Up to You!</h3><p>Text state to 50409, or to Resistbot on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/messages/compose?recipient_id=835740314006511618&amp;text=state\">Twitter</a>, <a href=\"https://m.me/resistbot\">Messenger</a>, or <a href=\"https://t.me/resistbot\">Telegram</a> and make your voice heard in state government!</p><p>And we would also love your engineering help with the next round of bold engineering projects.</p><ul><li>Make it possible to write to your city council!</li><li>Implement a flow to <a href=\"https://runforsomething.net/\">Run For Something</a>!</li><li>Teach Resistbot how to smartly categorize the topic of a user’s message!</li></ul><p><a href=\"mailto:volunteer@resist.bot\">Email us</a> to get started!

It is quoted here in its entirety:</p><blockquote>Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That, pursuant to section 202 of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622), the national emergency declared by the finding of the President on February 15, 2019, in Proclamation 9844 (84 Fed. Reg. 4949) is hereby terminated.</blockquote><p>By invoking section 202 of the National Emergencies Act, the House will <strong>force</strong> the Senate to vote on exactly this language <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/22/us/politics/national-emergency-pelosi.html\">in the next 18 days</a>. President Trump has already threatened to veto it but it’s uncertain if Republicans will hold together in opposition to the measure or not.</p><h3>H.R. 8 — Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2019</h3><p>HR 8 is an<a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/116/bills/hr8/BILLS-116hr8ih.pdf\"> extremely brief treatment of the so-called “gun-show loophole”</a> which allows people who could not otherwise pass a background check to buy a firearm from a private seller (a gun-show often features lots of private sellers, thus giving the loophole its name). HR 8 closes the loophole by requiring a background check for nearly every substantive transfer of firearms between non-family members. Reasonable exceptions are carved out for loaned firearms at ranges and basic hunter safety.</p><p>HR 8 has a reasonable chance of passing the House but slim odds in the Senate.</p><h3>H.R. 1112: Enhanced Background Checks Act of 2019</h3><p>Under current law, if a firearms background check fails to complete in three days, it counts as a “pass.” Jim Clayburn’s <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/1112?s=1&amp;r=25\">HR 1122</a> would lengthen the time allotted for background checks to 10 days and, if the check remains unfinished, count an unfinished check as a “fail” which can be appealed through the Attorney General’s office.</p><p>The firearm purchased by Dylann Roof, who murdered nine people at the Emmanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in 2015, <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2019/02/13/congress-guns-parkland-1168260\">was sold to him due to a failure to complete his background check within three days</a>.</p><h3>Tell Congress What You Think!</h3><p>You can weigh in on these or any other topic before Congress by sending the word Congress to Resistbot.

In a <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2018/11/08/665197690/a-boatload-of-ballots-midterm-voter-turnout-hit-50-year-high\">study done by the United States Election Project </a>, voter turnout was the highest it has been in fifty years with a national average of 47% of eligible voters casting a ballot. That is more than 110,000,000 votes cast making the 2018 midterms the first midterm cycle to ever exceed 100,000,000 votes. Impressive! There were a few states however, that left the national average in their dust. Arizona is one such state.</p><h4>The Good</h4><p>Arizona played host to one of the country’s most closely watched races: that of retiring Republican Senator Jeff Flake’s empty seat which was won by Democrat Kyrsten Sinema. Historically, at a national and local level, Arizona politics have been largely dominated by Republicans. If voter engagement for 2018 is any indicator, that may change as Arizona saw 65% of its eligible voters show up at the polls in November. That is 18% higher than the national average. Not too shabby.</p><h4>The Bad</h4><p>Along with record-setting voter turnout comes numerous claims of voter fraud. One such claim was made by Kelly Townsend (R, District 16) who was elected to her fourth term in November. According to Ms. Townsend, who heads the Arizona House Elections Committee, voter registration drives have become incentivized as a result of paying collectors on a per application basis. In response to this issue, Representative Townsend introduced <a href=\"https://trackbill.com/bill/arizona-house-bill-2616-registration-of-voters-payment-prohibition/1680321/\">HB 2616</a> that would make it a misdemeanor for an individual to be paid to register people to vote.</p><p>In a committee hearing held February 19, Representative Townsend called upon Yuma County Recorder, Robyn Stallworth Pouquette, to offer <a href=\"http://azleg.granicus.com/MediaPlayer.php?view_id=13&amp;clip_id=22114#\">testimony</a> as to her staff’s experience with voter fraud during the 2018 election. According to Ms. Pouquette, her office received many incomplete and duplicative applications which caused her small staff to spend considerable time reviewing them to insure they were completed correctly, that a particular voter was not registered twice, and that a voter’s party preference was clearly indicated. When errors were found, Ms. Pouquette’s staff would reach out to the voter to discuss whatever steps needed to be taken to correct their application or voting status. It is Representative Townsend’s contention that these problems are caused by the act of paying a person to obtain applications.</p><h4>The Ugly</h4><p>Representative Townsend’s proposed bill would prohibit individuals from paid work at voter registration drives. People who count on this type of work for primary or supplemental income would face criminal charges that are on par with those for domestic violence and DUI.</p><p>Furthermore, it may be yet one more barrier to civic engagement. For those who are homebound, work more than one job, or otherwise lack access to traditional resources, a knock on the door by a paid registrar or volunteer may be their only opportunity to participate in local and national politics. Without professional outreach, many Arizonans will never learn about absentee and/or early voting programs that can help them vote.</p><h4>What You Can Do</h4><p>Critics charge that this bill should be withdrawn because if we do away with paid drives, for what amounts to a very low percentage of fraudulent voter applications — certainly less than is needed to sway an election — the result will be fewer eligible voters added to the rolls each year. Fewer eligible voters means fewer people actively participating in the events that govern their lives.</p><p>Representative Townsend has stated that she is open to the possibility of amending her bill to require that registrars receive an hourly rate rather than being paid per-application as they are now.</p><p>If you live in District 16, send STATE to Resistbot and encourage Representative Townsend to withdraw her bill. If withdrawal is not on the table then she should amend it so as not to cut off this resource for new voters. If you live elsewhere, write to your Representative and encourage them to support amending Representative Townsend’s bill. And, as always, you can write to Congress about this or any other topic by sending the word Resist to Resistbot on <a href=\"http://m.me/resistbot\">Facebook Messenger</a>, <a href=\"http://t.me/resistbot\">Telegram</a>, or as a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/messages/compose?recipient_id=835740314006511618&amp;text=resist\">Twitter direct message</a>. If none of those work for you, Resistbot also supports old fashioned SMS: text RESIST to 50409 to get started. It takes 2 minutes to speak out.</p>"
