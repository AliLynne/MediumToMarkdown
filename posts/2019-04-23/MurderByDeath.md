The race to save the planet isnâ€™t just about saving the swirling rock we call home. The Earthâ€™s dance around the sun will continue until well after the last iteration of humanity and that of all the other creatures has come and gone. Itâ€™s really about saving ourselves.

It shouldnâ€™t take an international agreement to compel us to recognize the damage we have done to our planet and that the power to save ourselves lies in the hands of the current generation. Likewise, it shouldnâ€™t take a single scientistâ€Šâ€”â€Šmuch less 97% of scientists across 80 countriesâ€” to recognize that when we pour garbage into the atmosphere, the air that all living beings then breathe is polluted. We only get as good as we give which is why we need to abide by the terms of the Paris Agreement before itâ€™s too lateâ€Šâ€”â€Šbecause there will come a day when it is just tooÂ late.

The core tenet of the Paris Agreement is to strengthen the global response to climate change and to mitigate the damage we have done to the only home we may ever have. Additionally, all signatories have to report on those efforts. In support of that, H.R.9, the [Climate Action Now Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/9/text), sponsored by 150+ Representatives, was introduced on March 27, 2019. If successful, it will direct the President to develop a plan for the United States to meet its reporting requirements under the Paris Agreement, despite his 2017 declaration that we would be withdrawing. This bill has emerged from the Committee on Energy and Commerce and is scheduled to be heard on the House floor on **AprilÂ 29th**.

#### What you canÂ do

Reach out to your representative and let them know your thoughts on global warming. Send HOUSE to Resistbot and encourage your representative to support the Climate Action Now Act. And, as always, you can write to Congress about this or any other topic by sending the word Resist to Resistbot on [Facebook Messenger](http://m.me/resistbot), [Telegram](http://t.me/resistbot), or as a [Twitter direct message](https://twitter.com/messages/compose?recipient_id=835740314006511618&text=resist). If none of those work for you, Resistbot also supports old fashioned SMS: text RESIST to 50409 to get started. It takes 2 minutes to get goingÂ ðŸŒŽ.---
