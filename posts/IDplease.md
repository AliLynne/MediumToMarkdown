I’m…. IN A RESISTBOT ARTICLE!

Currently, the list of acceptable forms of identification for the voting process in Georgia has been a short one. That may change. If enacted, House Bill 211 and House Bill 522 will make voting easier for Georgians by expanding the list of acceptable forms of identification electors may use when registering to vote or casting a ballot at the polls.

[House Bill 211](http://www.legis.ga.gov/Legislation/en-US/display/20192020/HB/211) will allow those who attend private colleges and universities to use their school identifications at their polling location for the purpose of casting a vote and/or completing their voter’s certificate.

[House Bill 522](http://www.legis.ga.gov/Legislation/en-US/display/20192020/HB/522) will also increase the list of acceptable ID’s to include expired driver’s licenses and ID cards, a hunting or fishing license, and even a driver’s license from another state.

#### What you can do

The Bill is currently pending with the House Committee on Governmental Affairs. Send STATE to Resistbot and encourage your Representatives to support this bill and make it just a little bit easier to vote in Georgia. And, as always, you can write to Congress about this or any other topic by sending the word Resist to Resistbot on [Facebook Messenger](http://m.me/resistbot), [Telegram](http://t.me/resistbot), or as a [Twitter direct message](https://twitter.com/messages/compose?recipient_id=835740314006511618&text=resist). If none of those work for you, Resistbot also supports old fashioned SMS: text RESIST to 50409 to get started. It takes 2 minutes to speak out.
